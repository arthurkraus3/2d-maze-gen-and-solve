2D Maze Generation and Solver

Basically load all of this into Eclipse (or whatever IDE you prefer) 

DO NOT RUN WITH DEFAULT ENCODER UNLESS YOU WANT TO SEE ?? instead of the proper unicode.
RUN CONFIGURATION ->> Under the main horizontal tabs all the way to the right select Common (might be hidden) 
                    ->> Encoding use Other -> UTF-8 
                    
                    See https://eclipsesource.com/blogs/2013/02/21/pro-tip-unicode-characters-in-the-eclipse-console/
                      for more help.


This is just the beginning, we'll be working on the 3D variant over winter 2018-9
